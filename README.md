# BookPal
A chatbot using Regular Expressions, written in Python

BookPal is a chatbot that provides information about a user-requested book. It uses Regular Expressions to recognize simple input patterns and respond accordingly. The type of questions that can be answered can be found in the documentation file. To retrieve information about books, the Google Books API is used. Furthermore, the application provides a simple GUI for interaction with BookPal.

To run the program, execute the "bookpal.py" file. In order be able to execute the app on a higher level, the code files are compressed as executables in the corresponding folders. Currently, there are executables for Windows and Linux, and there will soon be added for macOS as well. Notice that, because the project contains these files, it may appear as potentially malicious while trying to download. If you feel insecure about that, you can always download the .py and .ico files only.
